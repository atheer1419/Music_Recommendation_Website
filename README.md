Music impacts us in ways that other sounds don’t, and for years now, scientists have been
wondering why. “Music affects deep emotional centers in the brain, “ says Valorie Salimpoor, a
neuroscientist at McGill University who studies the brain on music. “A single sound tone is not
really pleasurable in itself; but if these sounds are organized over time in some sort of arrangement,
it’s amazingly powerful.”
